The portage-bashrc-mv project is meant to be used with the
gentoo portage system and serves two purposes.

1. It provides support for an `/etc/portage/bashrc.d` directory in which
   you can define functions which are executed during emerge phases.
2. It provides the following functionality in `/etc/portage/bashrc.d`
   - Support for an `/etc/portage/package.cflags` file (or directory)
     in which you can easily execute tasks or modify variables like CFLAGS
     on a per-package basis.
     This is similar to using `/etc/portage/env` but has a more
     convenient syntax for e.g. modifying `CFLAGS`.
     There is also a special flag filtering for non-GNU compilers
     (mainly clang).
     Moreover, pgo (profile-guided optimization) is supported.
   - Support for removing undesired `.la` files before installation
   - Support for removing undesired locales before installation
   - Support for `CCACHE_*` variables.
   - Output of time information and title bar if
     `app-portage/portage-utils` and `app-shells/runtitle`
     (the latter from the mv overlay) are installed.

See `bashrc.d/README` for more details.

For installation, just copy `bashrc` and `bashrc.d` into `/etc/portage`.
There is also an ebuild in the `mv` repository
(available by `app-select/eselect-repository` or `app-portage/layman`).
