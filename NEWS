portage-bashrc-mv-17.1
----------------------
Fix of regression from 17.0 when parsing time


portage-bashrc-mv-17.0
----------------------
No longer work with <app-portage/portage-utils-0.74-r1, but support instead
>=app-portage/portage-utils-0.80_pre20190605.


portage-bashrc-mv-16.0
----------------------
New localepurge configuration; ignore that of app-admin/localepurge


portage-bashrc-mv-15.0
----------------------
Support MESONDEDUP:
>=meson-0.47 had the insane idea to forbid the user to specify flags
simultaneously in e.g. LDFLAGS and CFLAGS.
Although the same flags must necessarily be specified in some cases during
compile and link phase, meson insists to have the sole decision about this,
thus breaking with *FLAGS meant to be used also for other build systems.
As a workaround, portage-bashrc-mv now supports a variable MESONDEDUP:
If this variable is true then all flags from LDFLAGS which can occur
already in some other compile phase are removed.


portage-bashrc-mv-14.4
----------------------
unless CCACHE_HASHDIR is set to true, CCACHE_NOHASHDIR is now set.
This effectively means that the ccache default of that variable is inverted.
This should increase the number of ccache hits in average although in some
cases it might cause issues: Try setting CCACHE_HASHDIR=1 in case of
miscompilations with ccache.


portage-bashrc-mv-14.0
----------------------
Improve support/customization for filtering *FLAGS depending on the compiler.


portage-bashrc-mv-13.0
----------------------

Important!

If you use >=portage-2.2.15 and have previously used <portage-bashrc-mv-13
you will get problems, because <portage-bashrc-mv-13 modified EBUILD_PHASE
which has been declared readonly in >=portage-2.2.15, and thus modification
leads to an error abort of portage.
In this case you have to run once

fix-portage-2.2.15 [if you use prefix-portage, use your $EPREFIX as argument]

This command will fix the environment.bz2 files in ${1%/}/var/db/pkg
which were generated with <portage-bashrc-mv-13 and which are
incompatible with the mentioned change in portage-2.2.15

(Unfortunately, it is not possible to fix this in portage-bashrc-mv alone,
since environment.bz2 is used for unmerging, overriding portage-bashrc-mv.)

Execute fix-portage-2.2.15 as the first command after upgrading portage-2.2.15!
